# Katas we love

This repository is a mix of Papers We Love and katas: a place where to store katas for future reference.

## How-To

  * Create a new header (h3 - `###`) with the title.
  * Create a human-readable description as the body of the element
  * Create a `Tags` element specifying any information about the kata, in machine readable form:
    * comma-separated tags
    * all lowercase
    * prefer using nouns (rather than verbs)
    * Suggestion: 
      * include the topic
      * the author
      * what to learn
      * what to practice
      * the programming language
      * the size of the exercise
      * and anything else that comes to your mind

## Contents

### [Legacy code katas](http://www.devjoy.com/2013/01/legacy-code-katas/)

Take a legacy codebase and refactor to separate the concerns.

The code is small enough to be understood at once, but big enough to add validation, input and output, side effects.

Plus: 

  * Use only automatic refactorings until you have broken the dependencies

### [Tell don't ask kata](https://github.com/gabrieletondi/tell-dont-ask-kata)

A refactoring kata with nearly perfect code coverage in which the feature envy smell is very strong. Almost all behavior is separated from its data and the domain is anemic.
