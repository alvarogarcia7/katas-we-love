## How-To

  * Create a new header (h3 - `###`) with the title.
  * Create a `Tags` element specifying any information about the kata, in machine readable form:
comma-separated tags, all lowercase, prefer using nouns (rather than verbs). Suggestion: include the topic, the author, what to learn
what to practice, the programming language, the size of the exercise, and anything else that comes to your mind
